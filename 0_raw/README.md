### Overview
This directory contains only this README describing the raw data used throughout this project. 
All the raw data can be found in the following dropbox folder: FILL THIS IN WITH LINK TO FOLDER 
### Source
    ### ENOE Data 
        All ENOE data comes from the INEGI. 
    ### Colombian Cocaine Seizures Data
        Data on Colombian cocaine seizures is from the Colombian Department of Defense 
        The data was kindly shared with me by Daniel Mej√≠a 
    ### Geographic Data 
        Geographic data can be found online in the form of shape files. 
    ### Population Data 
        All municipal population data comes from CONAPO. Reported annually and 
        interpolated assuming linear monthly growth between yearly observations
    ### Mexican CPI Data 

    ### Mexican Drug Seizures Data 

    ### Homicide Data (2 sources must be combined)

### When/where obtained & original form of files
    ### ENOE Data 
         Data for each quarter can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enoe/15ymas/#microdatos
            - For years 2007-2020T1
                - Download DTA, will come in the form of a zip file called "YYYYtrim#_dta.zip" (where # is a number 1-4, indicating the quarter)
                - Open folder and only keep .dta files labeled COE1T#YY, COE2T#YY, HOGT#YY, SDEMT#YY, and VIVT#YY (disregard .txt file)
            - For years 2020T2-2023
                - Download DTA, will come in the form of a zip file called "enoe_n_YYYY_trim#_dta.zip" (where # is a number 1-4, indicating the quarter)
                - Open folder and only keep .dta files labeled ENOE(N)_COE1T#YY, ENOE(N)_COE2T#YY, ENOE(N)_HOGT#YY, ENOE(N)_SDEMT#YY, and ENOE(N)_VIVT#YY 
(disregard .txt file)
                - Note: Becase of COVID, 2020T2 is skipped

    ### Geographical Data 

### Description
Briefly describe the contents of the subdirectories and files. You do not necessarily need to describe each file separately, but a user should be able to look at 
the directory and understand the organization and purpose of the files.

### Terms of Use
All data used in this repo is public and can be used for any research or other purpose 
### Notes
It is important to be very careful with downloading ENOE onto local hard drive.
The raw files for the ENOE spanning from 2007-2023 take up roughly 72.0GB of 
storage. I have chosen to use dropbox to store all the raw data and an external
hard drive for all intermediary files in my code.

When running the code in 1_data, there are a few things to keep in mind. Files are large and the scripts used to merge them may sometimes throw errors of the kind "vector memory reached" ... if that occurs (mainly for cohorts 50-53, 60, and 61 in make_cohorts_enoe.r & for 2020 T4, 2021 T1, and 2021 T2 in make_quarterly_enoe.r) consider converting .dta files to .parquet and reading them in with read_parquet() in the arrow package [can use script cohort_by_hand.py to do so] or removing unecessary columns eraly by only keeping the intersection with another quarter (e.g. 2019 T2), respectively.
